# Information about outputting B-factor re-assigned PDBs and dms-view inputs
#
# Top-level keys are PDBs
# Under each PDB key, specify:
#  pdbfile -> path to file containing PDB
#  chains -> list of chain(s) to which we map colors, typically RBD chains
#  conditions -> conditions (antibodies / sera) for which we write this PDB,
#                set to ALL  for all conditions


# 7wpb is ACE2 bound BA.1 RBD
7wpb:
  pdbfile: data/pdbs/7wpb_BA1.pdb
  chains:
    - A
  conditions: ALL
